 * CPU Control Lines
 * The three least significant bits in the port register (address 1) correspond to the three control lines in the port used for bank switching. To use these control lines, they must be configured as outputs, i.e. the same three least significant bits in the port's directional data register (at address 0) must be set to 1. This is the default upon power-up, but a programmer may want to make certain of this before bank switching. The control lines, in general, perform the function given in their descriptions. However, a combination of control lines are occasionally used to set a particular memory configuration.
 *
 * LORAM (bit 0, weight 1) is a control line which banks the 8 kByte BASIC ROM in or out of the CPU address space. Normally, this line is logically high (set to 1) for BASIC operation. If this line is logically low (cleared to 0), the BASIC ROM will typically disappear from the memory map and be replaced by 8 kBytes of RAM from $A000-$BFFF. Some exceptions to this rule exist; see the table below for a full overview.
 * HIRAM (bit 1, weight 2) is a control line which banks the 8 kByte KERNAL ROM in or out of the CPU address space. Normally, this line is logically high (set to 1) for KERNAL ROM operation. If this line is logically low (cleared to 0), the KERNAL ROM will typically disappear from the memory map and be replaced by 8 kBytes of RAM from $E000-$FFFF. Some exceptions to this rule exist; see the table below for a full overview.
 * CHAREN (bit 2, weight 4) is a control line which banks the 4 kByte character generator ROM in or out of the CPU address space. From the CPU point of view, the character generator ROM occupies the same address space as the I/O devices ($D000-$DFFF). When the CHAREN line is set to 1 (as is normal), the I/O devices appear in the CPU address space, and the character generator ROM is not accessible. When the CHAREN bit is cleared to 0, the character generator ROM appears in the CPU address space, and the I/O devices are not accessible. The CPU only needs to access the character generator ROM when downloading the character set from ROM to RAM. CHAREN can be overridden by other control lines in certain memory configurations. CHAREN will have no effect on any memory configuration without I/O devices. RAM will appear from $D000-$DFFF instead.
